      <h1>Knitting Lessons</h2>
      <p>So you want to learn how to knit? Or maybe you already know how to knit, but want to know how to knit better. Either way, you've come to the right place! The Knitting Guild has a variety of lessons and instructors available to teach you what you want to know! Lessons are individiualized to meet the goals and needs of each student, so you can be sure that no matter your learning style or desired knowledge, you'll be getting the best instruction for you!
      </p>

      <h2>Specific Project Lessons</h2>
      <p>We offer lessons specialized to specific areas. Maybe your goal isn't to become an expert knitter. Maybe you have just one project you want to complete, such as making a nice handmade gift like a sweater, scarf, or hat for a boyfriend, parent, or other loved one. If that's your goal but you have no idea where to start, or you started but can't seem to get your project to go where you want it to or have no idea what to do next, you've come to the right place! Our instructors have all been there before, and they can help you through that project so you can give your beloved the thoughtful, one-of-a-kind gift they deserve!
      </p>

      <h2>General Lessons</h2>
      <p>So you want to learn to knit but just can't seem to pick it up on your own? Or maybe you already knit but just can't seem to get a certain technique down. We can help! No matter what area you need instruction in, we have a member who's an expert on that area and willing to share their experience! In just a few lessons, you could be knitting your own sweater, or making those lovely doilies you've always wanted to!
