    <h1>The Story of the Knitting Guild</h1>
    <p>The story of the founding of the Knitting Guild is a rather funny one. It all started one cold night in September back in 1968, when our humble foundress Agatha Newstaff, then still known as Agatha Lowburn, couldn't find anything suitable to wear to her middle school's annual Sweater Jumper dance. In frustration she tore her parent's two story townhouse apart, leaving no closet unturned, eventually moving to the attic in her frantic search for the perfect sweater.</p>

    <h2 id ="inspiration">Inspiration Down the Generations</h2>
    <p>It was here that Miss Agatha Lowburn struck gold. Amid the moldering family heirlooms, seasonal storage, and accumulated familial clutter, she found the ideal specimen for her school's dance. It was a soft, old sweater of a pale golden color that was just slightly too large for her and loose in all the right places to sway along with her dancing. She shook the dust from it and put it on without a thought to where it came from, eager to make it to the dance on time. It was only after that night that young Agatha discovered the sweater wasn't just another department store offering but a one-of-a-kind item that had been handknit by her late grandmother for her own mother to wear to a Christmas Party back in the day. She was amazed when her mother told her that her dear old granny had been the one to create this beautiful piece of clothing. Agatha longed to know how it was done.

    <h2>Determination and Spirit</h2>
    <p>Nobody had ever accused young Agatha of being particularly gifted with her hands, nor of being especially artistic. In fact, she was praised rather for her sharp wit and keen math skills, so her parents were shocked when she showed an interest in knitting. Young Agatha's first attempts were, to be quite frank, simply horrendous, and there were many times when she was on the verge of giving up and returning to her simpler activities of watching television and preserving dried insects. But then something amazing happened. Agatha's kindly neighbor, Mrs. Asflac, was an avid knitter and gossip, so she quickly found out about Agatha's new interest and failed attempts, and got it into her mind to make Agatha her prodigy. Now Agatha at the time found the idea of spending time with Mrs. Asflac mortifying, but her mother had always told her to be polite to Mrs. Asflac, so Agatha was forced to spend every afternoon at her house, eating cookies that were too dry and being told Mrs. Asflac's life story in little pieces as she taught Agatha how to knit. Before too long, Agatha's messy tangles of yarn became uncoordinated potholders, and then cleverly crafted doll clothing for Agatha's little sister, and by next summer's county fair, Agatha was making real clothing for her sister and won first prize in the youth craft division that year. Agatha grew to love both Mrs. Asflac and knitting, and from that year onward has almost never spent a day without her knitting needles and yarn nearby.

    <h2>Passing on the Passion</h2>
    <p>Although Agatha was a lifelong knitter, it wasn't until 2005, when her husband passed away from lung cancer, that she decided to take it to the next level. In today's world of technology and mass-produced machine-made clothing, knitting is quickly becoming a lost art. Now alone in an everchanging world, Agatha decided to reach out to others in the community and form a group dedicated to preserving and passing on the skills of making handmade clothing. On December 14th, 2005 the Knitting Guild had it's first bimonthly meeting and consisted of just 5 members. Since then, the Guild has grown in numbers and influence thanks to Mrs. Newstaff's wise guidance, and creations of its members have been featured in several national magazines on handmade arts and crafts, as well as in local exhibitions and even one museum. The Guild is now 50+ members strong and still growing, and offers knitting lessons as well as hosting an annual benefit for sufferers of lung cancer and their families that has raised billions of dollars towards the cause over the last five years.
