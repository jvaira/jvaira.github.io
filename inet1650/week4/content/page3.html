    <h2>A Place of Friendship</h2>
    <p>The Knitting Guild is more than just a club; for many of us, it's our family, even our home. Therefore each and every member, no matter how brief a time they spent with us, has an irreplaceable spot in each of our hearts, and will always be a part of the ever-deepening legacy of our guild.
    </p>

    <h2>Those That Have Gone On</h2>
    <p>Over the years, many of our members have passed away into the beyond. This page is to commemorate those members and their contributions to the Guild and to our lives. They are gone but not forgotten, and will be remembered fondly by the current guildmembers and their families. May they rest in peace.
    </p>
