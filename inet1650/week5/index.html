      Here are the six I chose:
    <br>
    <img src="images/facebook-900w.png" alt="facebook-900w.png" width="90" title="the facebook icon">
    <br>
    I chose the .png version of this picture, because it's considerably smaller than the other two and the same or around the same quality.
    <br>
    <img src="images/inkscape-900w.png" alt="inkscape-900w.png" height="200" title="inkscape logo">
    <br>
    I chose the .png version again, because it was a bit smaller than the other two. The .jpg version seemed to handle the gradient a bit better, but was larger, and I didn't think the slight banding on the other two from cutting back their color channels was going to be too much of a concern given the size I planned to display it, so I went with the smallest one.
    <br>
    <img src="images/jello-900w.png" alt="jello-900w.png" width="350" title="a nice jelly">
    <br>
    I chose the .png again, because it was the same or near identical quality to the other two but significantly smaller.
    <br>
    <img src="images/sheridan-900w.jpg" alt="sheridan-900w.jpg" height="500" title="downtown mainstreet">
    <br>
    This time I chose the .jpg, because it was not only better quality than the other two but also a lot smaller.
    <br>
    <img src="images/student-life-900w.jpg" alt="student-life-900w.jpg" width="250" title="students">
    <br>
    I chose the .jpg, because it handled all the colors and blending best and was also the smallest size of the three.
    <br>
    <img src="images/watermellon-900w.png" alt="watermellon-900w.png" height="500" title="watermelon">
    <br>
    This one was a bit hard to pick. Even though the .png was the largest of the files, I ended up choosing it because it allows the file to have a transparent background and good quality of its blended areas, so had the best integrity towards the original file.
