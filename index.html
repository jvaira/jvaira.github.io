<section id=triopsIntroduction>
<h2>What Are They?</h2>
	<p>Triops are crustaceans, like lobsters, shrimp, or sea-monkeys (which are actually just brine shrimp!) Like sea-monkeys, their eggs can be dried and stored, then exposed to water to activate. They have existed for hundreds of millions of years, and have adapted to live in temporary pools of water, meaning that their lives are fast and short, and their eggs <em>very</em> hardy.</p>

<hgroup>
<h2>How Old...?</h2>
<h3>(Hint: very, very old...)</h3>
</hgroup>
	<p>Fossils of triops have been dated back to 300 million years ago. One species, <em>Triops Cancriformis</em>, hasn't changed for  <em>180 million years</em><sup>[1]</sup>. Their adaptations must work very well for them, because that's a <b>long</b> time!</p>

<h2>Where Can I Get Some?</h2>
	<p>Due to their coolness factor, triops eggs are available for purchase from a variety of places, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Online Shops like Amazon.com</li>
			<li>Walmart</li>
			<li>Pet Shops and Toy Stores</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>What Kind of Triops Can I Get?</h2>
	<p>There are two species of triops commonly sold in the pet trade: <i>triops cancriformis</i> and <i>triops longicaudatus</i>. There are many other species in the world and some of them are also kept by hobbyists, but these are the two species you'll likely come across as a beginner. Both make great pets and are raised the same way, but there are a few minor differences between the two:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><i>Triops Cancriformis</i></dt>
		<dd><i>Triops Cancriformis</i> are found wild in Europe, the middle East, and India. They are the second most common species kept in captivity, and generally live slightly longer than <i>triops longicaudatus</i>.</dd>
		<dd>There is an albino variety of <i>triops cancriformis</i> that was originally bred in Japan. Called <ruby>べにーカブトエビ<rp>(</rp><rt>Beni-Kabuto Ebi</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> albino triops, they are more commonly called red triops, orange triops, or albino triops. Their shells are clearer than those of normal triops, allowing you to see the hemoglobin in their blood and giving them their red color. </dd>
		<dt><i>Triops Longicaudatus</i></dt>
		<dd><i>Triops Longicaudatus </i> are found wild in North and South America and Japan. They are the most common species kept in captivity.</dd>

	<h2>I've Got My Triops, Now What?</h2>
	<p>Once you've purchased your triops eggs, you'll probably want to start hatching them right away. Most eggs come in kits that include a small hatching tank, but if yours didn't, that's okay! Triops aren't that picky about where they hatch, so almost any container that holds water will be suitable. An old jam jar, your mother's flower vase, a fish bowl, all of these would be an okay hatching environment. What's important is that the tank you use is clean and large enough to support the number of triops you plan on hatching and keeping to adulthood (when crowded, triops will eat their siblings until there is only one big triop left, and if the tank is even too small for him he'll be quite stessed and more likely to die). They'll need a bigger tank later, but for the first week or two a smaller container will make it easier for them to find their food.</p>

	<p>When you've got your tank clean and ready, it's time to fill it with water and dump your egg mixture in. But <em>wait</em>! <strong>Don't just use water from your sink.</strong> Most of the chemicals put into our water in order to keep it clean and free from dangerous bacteria or other contaminants also impede the growth or hatching of triops, so if you use tap water they may not hatch at all, or hatch but die soon afterwards. You can try leaving a container of tap water sitting out for 24 hours to let the chemicals disssapate off, but because the hatching stage is a critical part of their lives many people recommend using bottled mineral or distilled water in the hatching tank, and using tap water treated with dechlorination tablets for later water changes.</p>

	<h3>Hatching and Beyond</h3>
	<p>Once you've dumped your egg mixture into the water, it will take several days for your triops to hatch. They hatch sooner at warmer temperatures, so keep that in mind. After hatching, they will appear as tiny moving specks in the tank. When you notice them, throw them the tiniest bit of triops food, unless otherwise instructed by the instructions that came with your triops. Be careful-too much food, and bacteria will start to grow on the excess food and cause your triops to die, too little and you'll end up with fewer triops, as they will glady eat their siblings. It's hard finding the right balance, so don't worry too much about it-as long as at least one of the triops survives, it will probably lay eggs, and you can try to perfect the amount next time. </p>

	<p>Once the triops are big enough to be easily seen, you may want to move them to their adult tank, depending on how many there are and how big their hatching tank is. Remember that any water you use for them should be dechlorinated-either through dissipation or dechlorination tablets. Feed them two or three times a day, as much as they'll eat but no more-bacteria growth is still a concern. You can put a plant in their tank for them to snack on as well-that will minimilize cannablism while avoiding the danger of too much bacteria in the water. They are messy creatures, so you'll need to scoop about 1/3 of their water out every week and replace it with fresh water. A filtration system or oxygenator can also be used to improve water quality, but are not necessary. Make sure to put sand or gravel on the bottom of the tank, as they not only love to dig, but the substrate will also protect the eggs they lay from being eaten by the adults-yes, they will eat their own eggs. As mentioned before, triops have no qualms with cannabilism!<p>

	<p>If all goes well, your triops will live two to three months, depending on the species. When the last of them dies, don't feel bad-triops just don't have a long lifespan. They evolved to live and thrive in temporary pools that quickly dissapear, so longevity was never part of their design. There may be an occassional stragler that lives for months, but generally they don't make it that long. It's not over, though. Remember the eggs. Your triops will have been breeding and/or cloning themselves (through a neat trick called parthenogenesis) this whole time, laying eggs on the floor of the tank. When all the adults die, remove most of the water, but leave the bottom inch and the substrate undisturbed. Let it dry out completely and stay that way for about two weeks(or, if you can't wait that long, take some of it and freeze it to trick the eggs into thinking a whole season has passed), then take a small amount of it and put it in the hatching tank with some dechlorinated water and a piece of grass or other plant material. You should have more triops in a few days. The rest of the substrate should also contain eggs (which are too small to really be seen by the naked eye) as well, so keep some or all of it in case you need them. <i>Voila</i>! A perpetual pet! If you keep going like this, you should never need to buy more triops eggs again. And best of all, if you get tired of having triops, you don't have to hatch the eggs. They will do quite fine being dried and sealed away in a plastic bag until you want them again, and can even stay dormant like that for 10 or more years, ready to hatch out again next time you give them a chance. Talk about instant pets!</p>
