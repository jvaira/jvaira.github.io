<h2>What Are They?</h2>
<p>Triops are crustaceans, like lobsters, shrimp, or sea-monkeys (which are actually just brine shrimp!) Like sea-monkeys, their eggs can be dried and stored, then exposed to water to activate. They have existed for hundreds of millions of years, and have adapted to live in temporary pools of water, meaning that their lives are fast and short, and their eggs <em>very</em> hardy.</p>

<h2>How Old...?</h2>
<p>Fossils of triops have been dated back to 300 million years ago. One species, <em>Triops Cancriformis</em>, hasn't changed for  <em>180 million years</em><sup>[1]</sup>. Their adaptations must work very well for them, because that's a <b>long</b> time!</p>

<h2>Where Can I Get Some?</h2>
<p>Due to their coolness factor, triops eggs are available for purchase from a variety of places, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Online Shops like Amazon.com</li>
	<li>Walmart</li>
	<li>Pet Shops and Toy Stores</li>
</ul>
